gakucho-benchmark

A Multimodal Benchmark from Japan’s National Assessment of Academic Ability (Grade 9)
This repository provides a curriculum-grounded multimodal benchmark built from officially released middle-school items in Science, Mathematics, and Japanese Language. The dataset preserves figures, math expressions, and vertical Japanese text, enabling vision-language evaluation rather than text-only reasoning. 


Why this matters: Japanese K–12 exam materials mix vertical text, diagrams, charts, speech balloons, and irregular panel layouts, which are pedagogically helpful yet machine-unfriendly (OCR errors, panel segmentation, linking labels to figures). Our pipeline normalizes these into a structured, reproducible JSON schema
